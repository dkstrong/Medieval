Poorlord's keep. Name tells it all. Very down to earth, dirty keep without any fancies. Dude so poor, can't even buy towers for his keep..

Learnt a few things AO baking and UVW mapping. Basically how wasteful I'm with space. Well next time more economical with the space.

If you have any issues, or there is something I could have done better, please let me know. Your input is appreciated!
